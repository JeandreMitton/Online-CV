                <h1>Welcome, a little bit about me</h1>
                <p>As a child I was always curious about technology and loved to LAN with my friends learning how networks and computers work as I grew up. From the age of 15, I got started in the coding field by taking IT as a subject and learned coding with Delphi. Since then my passion for coding just grew stronger as I learned more and more about how technology works and the importance of coding in every piece. Along with IT, I chose Art, Physics and Engineer's Graphical Design as my subjects of interest. Due to successive knee operations I had to drop Physics but never lost my interest in the field and kept up with as much of it as I could to this day. </br></br>In 2016 I graduated from High School Rustenburg and persued my dream of being the first in my family to get a degree and started studying at the North West University of Potchefstroom for BSc. Information Technology & Computer Science. Aiming to finish in 2020. Now I am excited to showcase my expertise as a qualified Software Engineer</p>

                <h1>Bits and Pieces.</h1>
                <p>As a student I did not have the chance to effectively gain experience. I have worked as a software tester for a new product being launched by Jericho Systems in Potchefstroom during June 2018. I was also given the role of a project manager for the company Prime Solution Projects and designed their logo in 2020.</p>
