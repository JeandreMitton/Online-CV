                <h1>Welcome yeah it's been a long minute</h1>
                <p>As a child I was always curious about technology and loved to LAN with my friends learning how networks an dcomputers work as I grew up. From the age of 15, I got started in the coding field by taking IT as a subject and learned coding with Delphi. Since then my passion for coding just grew stronger as I learned more and more about how technology works and the importance of coding in every piece. Along with IT I chose Art, Physics and Engineer's Graphical Design as my subjects of interest. Due to successive knee operations I had to drop Physics but never lost my interest in the field and kept up with as much of it as I could to this day. </br></br>In 2016 I graduated from High School Rustenburg and persued my dream of being the first in my family to get a degree and started studying at the North West University of Potchefstroom for BSc. Information Technology & Computer Science. Aiming to finish in 2020 I am excited to show my expertise as a qualified Software Engineer</p>
